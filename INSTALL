Installation Instructions
*************************

Dependencies
============

* APR (http://apr.apache.org/)
* libConfuse (http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/)
* expat (http://expat.sourceforge.net/)
* python (http://www.python.org/)
* RRDtool (http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/)
* GNU Make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* GNU C Compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org/)

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.

If your default make is not GNU Make you might want to use the appropiate
command invocation instead (probably gmake) because some of the Makefile
rules might not be compatible with your system make, resulting in a failed
build.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix

Optional Features
=================

support for python as a metric scripting language is optional and could be
disabled by using :

  --disable-python

gmetad is only needed to be able to generate reports and summary of the metric
data collected and so will only be built if explicitally requested with :

  --with-gmetad

for more details in some of the flags available refer to the README and the
ouput of :

  ./configure --help
