Certainly there are hundreds of features not in this version, but of the more
obvious:

- The "scalable" configuration attribute is not currently supported.
- The "server_threads" configuration attribute is not currently supported.

In addition, we don't currently have any data on the following:

- Comparative data to compare disk and runtime footprint to current gmetad.
- Throughput and performance data as compared to current gmetad.
- Stability data - memory usage over time, ability to continue running for
  long periods of time, etc.
- Correctness testing - honoring of all configuration parameters and
  command-line parameters, generation of correct data, etc.
- Cross-platform capabilities.
