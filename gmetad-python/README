Matt Ryan (mryan at novell dot com) - Initial Version

This represents the initial version of the rewritten gmetad in python.
Files are:

- gmetad_config.py
- gmetad_daemon.py
- gmetad_data.py
- gmetad_gmondReader.py
- gmetad.py
- gmetad_random.py
- gmetad_xmlWriter.py
- gmetad_consistency_test.py (test script)

This version should function generally as a gmetad replacement for reading
gmond data and providing aggregate data on XML ports only.

Advertised capabilities of this version include:

- Support of current gmetad configuration files - should "just work" by
  pointing it directly to an existing gmetad.conf file.
- Most current gmetad command-line options, plus a few others.
- Six log levels as per the python "logging" module.  Two of these - FATAL and
  CRITICAL - are functionally equivalent but indicated separately in the
  command-line parameters.  The default logging or debug level is 2, meaning
  that all messages ERROR level and higher will be logged.  A specified debug
  level of 5 or higher means all debug messages are shown and that the
  application stays in the foreground.
- Logging is done to syslog, optionally by appending to a log file in addition
  to syslog.  If the debug level is 5 or higher, logging is also done to the
  console.
- At a logging level of 4 or below, the application will go through the
  daemonizing process (setuid to another user, fork twice, set session id,
  change working dir to "/" and set umask to 0, close all open file descriptors
  except the logging file descriptors, and redirect all other I/O to /dev/null.
- Writes a PID file that can be used for graceful shutdowns later (kill -TERM).
- Creates a reader thread for every data source specified in the configuration.
  All data is stored internally in a single data structure which is updated on
  every read.
- Readers honor the polling interval specified in the data source configuration
  but vary the interval by +- 5 seconds.
- Listens on the XML and Interactive ports.  XML port is a dump of all stored
  data in a single XML file.  Interactive waits for input from the user then
  dumps the XML.
- Interactive port supports basic pathing filters, such as /Gridname/
  Clustername/Hostname/Metricname.
- Interactive port ignores filters that don't match the corresponding level in
  the XML - in other words, all data at that level will be sent, and no
  filtering applied, if the specified filter doesn't match any of the tags at
  that level.
- Shuts down gracefully at SIGTERM (generally this is true, unless an exception
  occurs - and even then, it usually works...).
